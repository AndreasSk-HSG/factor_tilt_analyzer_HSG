## Topic motivation:
In finance, portfolio risk is often assessed based on how sensitive the portfolio is to overall market movements. Market movements, in this context, refer to the returns of a market benchmark portfolio (e.g., the S&P 500 Index). The traditional assumption in many financial models is therefore that, for well-diversified investors, sensitivity to aggregate market movements is the only relevant measure of risk. However, research by Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997) showed that other factors such as size, value, and momentum also play a key, and often even more important role in explaining a portfolioâ€™s risk exposure. For example, their research demonstrates that smaller-sized firms (proxied by market capitalization) earn consistently higher returns than larger firms. Overweighting small firms in a portfolio, however, might additional risk to a portfolio that is not captured by traditional risk measures. Since the work of Fama and French, these additional factors have become widely accepted in both academic research and professional investment practice. Yet, despite their importance, retail investors still face significant barriers when trying to assess their own portfolios in terms of these factor exposures. This tool aims to bridge that gap by enabling users to easily analyze how their portfolios are exposed to these key risk factors.
